Prototype of a blacksmith incremental / clicker / idle game. Craft dozens of different items to become the best blacksmith in the town.

## To-Do list :

This is a non-exhaustive list of all the things that need to be added to the game

### Game

- Setup a random quest system : Every random interval, the player receive a quest in the "Quest" tab asking him to craft x item y times.
Quests are unlimited trial, means that they don't have a time limit to be completed.

```
Craft 5 keys
```
- If quest system is added, add a notification top-left "New quest available!" appearing each time a quest is available. Small and minimalist

- Create a simple level system with progress bar, xp is earned with quests. Values for each xp gain  and for each level up requirement need to be easily customizable. Exemple :
```
           Quest : "Craft 3 keys" Reward : 10xp
```
